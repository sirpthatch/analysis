# Three Insights
1. People are indeed, in general, getting faster at running marathons.  From 2010 to 2023 the median runner shaved 9.1 minutes off their marathon time.  The median female runner experienced greater gains at shaving 10 minutes off, wheras men have reduced their times by only 7.4 minutes.
2. There has been a fairly consistent, steady reduction in marathon times the middle of the pack runner over the past 15 years of 42 seconds per year.  The top 10% of runners are improving faster, at roughly a minute per year.
3. If you breakup the results by their position in the overall distribution and then fit a linear predictor to it, you can see that in all groups - overall, men, and women, the faster runners are improving at a faster rate, and the slowest runners are staying relatively constant. (Linear fit plot).  The accuracy of the linear fit is interesting as well - there is more volatilty as runners get slower, meaning that faster runners are all getting faster as a group, whereas the improvements drop off as the pack slows down.
4. There are more marathon runners, though makeup of the marathon field has remained relatively constant.  The biggest gain has been from younger runners which has increased 5.5% to now a 51.9% majority ofthe pack, and the biggest decreases are all from age ranges of 35-54 (ranging from 1.2% decrease to 2.7% decrease).
